# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a regression-based machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, and property attributes. The goal is to preprocess data, engineer features, compare models, and select the best-performing model.

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship tasks.
